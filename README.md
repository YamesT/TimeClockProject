# TimeClockProject

Project that emulates a time clock.
Clock-in, clock-out, and paystub where you see how many hours you worked and how much pay you'll get.
Also you're able to register a clock-in ID.
There are other controllers and views that are in the project that are not yet functional and are not yet implemented into the project. Still working on those. The project does what it is intended to do though.
